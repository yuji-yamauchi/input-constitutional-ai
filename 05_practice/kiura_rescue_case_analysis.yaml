# =============================================================================
# Case Overview
# =============================================================================
case_overview:

  case_type: "Crisis intervention - extortion and confinement"
  duration: "8 days confinement"
  outcome: "Successful extraction and protection"

  systemic_failures:
    police: "Pre-notification made but no action taken"
    welfare_support: "Recognized perpetrator but took no action"

  reasons_for_inaction:
    - "No evidence"
    - "Outside jurisdiction"
    - "Afraid of being sued"
    - "No precedent"
    - "Someone else will do it"

  structural_insight: |
    Same structure as LLM's "pretending to read":
    There is a wall between "understanding" and "acting."

# =============================================================================
# Intervention Structure (5 Phases)
# =============================================================================
intervention_phases:

  phase_1_assessment:
    name: "Situation Assessment First"
    actions:
      - "Prefacing with 'I don't have accurate information' to let them talk"
      - "Checking mobile phone beforehand"
      - "Collecting prior information from multiple sources"
    skill: "Information gathering without judgment"

  phase_2_choice_preservation:
    name: "Not Imposing Judgment"
    actions:
      - "Presenting options: 'Do you want to hide it? Or...' "
      - "Being honest: 'If there's guilt, you should atone for it'"
    skill: "Respecting autonomy while providing reality check"

  phase_3_structural_understanding:
    name: "Seeing the Pattern"
    key_quotes:
      - "'The worst thing is probably that you can't cut the connection'"
      - "'Keeping it among themselves - that's actually common'"
    skill: "Recognizing individual problems as patterns"

  phase_4_physical_protection:
    name: "Immediate Physical Protection"
    actions:
      - "'I'm going to ignore the perpetrator and take you away'"
      - "'Your excuse is that you were taken'"
      - "'I'll prepare a hotel' - 'It's a hotel I know, so it's safe'"
      - "'Turn off your phone' - 'If they call, I'll answer'"
    skill: "Creating immediate safety, taking on confrontation"

  phase_5_survival_conditions:
    name: "Establishing Survival Conditions First"
    actions:
      - "'For now, get some sleep tonight'"
      - "'Tomorrow, let's go eat something good'"
    skill: "Physiological safety before psychological processing"

# =============================================================================
# Reproducibility Assessment
# =============================================================================
reproducibility:

  question: "What percentage of support workers could reproduce this judgment?"
  answer: "Less than 5%"

  difficulty_factors:
    - factor: "Not giving 'correct' advice"
      description: "Knowing the 'right thing' but deliberately not saying it"

    - factor: "Not blaming someone with 'leverage' against them"
      description: "Understanding vulnerability without adding shame"

    - factor: "Checking the mobile phone"
      description: "Requires trust relationship AND judgment ability"

    - factor: "'I'll answer' (direct confrontation)"
      description: "Willingness to directly face the perpetrator"

    - factor: "Seeing 'structure'"
      description: "Pattern recognition, not individual problem framing"

# =============================================================================
# SoE Value Proposition
# =============================================================================
soe_implication:

  statement: |
    If this judgment can be "languaged" and "structured" in a reproducible form,
    the remaining 95% of support workers may be able to use it.
    That is the value of SoE.

  what_needs_to_be_captured:
    - "Decision trees that seem like 'intuition'"
    - "Risk assessment that seems like 'experience'"
    - "Timing judgments that seem like 'gut feeling'"

  connection_to_research:
    masters: "Position as 'crisis intervention skill' under assessment framework"
    doctoral: "Connect to abuse infection model prevention"

# =============================================================================
# Transmission Limitation Insight
# =============================================================================
transmission_limitation:

  core_problem: |
    No matter how precisely languaged,
    without the recipient's schema, it "cannot be read."

  transmission_structure: |
    Practitioner's experience ("blood")
        ↓
    Languaging (time-limited)
        ↓
    Converted through recipient's schema
        ↓
    Recipient's cognition (something different)

  schema_gap_examples:
    - topic: "8 days of confinement"
      experienced_reader: "Ah, so that's what it was... (clicks into place)"
      inexperienced_reader: "Does that really happen?"

    - topic: "Police don't act"
      experienced_reader: "That's a common story"
      inexperienced_reader: "That must be a special case"

    - topic: "Self-esteem increased after incident"
      experienced_reader: "Structurally that makes sense"
      inexperienced_reader: "Isn't that measurement error? n=1, right?"

# =============================================================================
# Three Layers Unique to This Case
# =============================================================================
unique_value:

  statement: |
    Normally, one person doesn't have all three layers:

  three_layers:
    - layer: "Theory"
      content: "Anomie factor, Hubris factor, abuse infection model"

    - layer: "Data"
      content: "NOCC self-esteem measurements (before/after incident comparison)"

    - layer: "Practice"
      content: "Rescue operation when police wouldn't act"

  why_rare:
    - "Theorists don't go to the field"
    - "Practitioners don't measure"
    - "People who measure don't participate in rescue operations"

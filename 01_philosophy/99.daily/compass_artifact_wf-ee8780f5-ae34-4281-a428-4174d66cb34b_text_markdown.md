# Critical Validation of Welfare Power Limitarianism and Dual-Pole Cognitive Distortion Model

The Service of Empowerment (SoE) framework proposes a genuinely novel theoretical synthesis—but builds on several unvalidated assumptions and enters contested philosophical terrain. **Robeyns' limitarianism has never been formally extended to non-economic domains**, creating both opportunity and risk: the framework could pioneer new territory or face rejection as a category error. This validation identifies where SoE stands on solid ground, where it needs reinforcement, and where fundamental reconceptualization may be required before approaching Robeyns.

## Section 1: Prior art reveals both gaps and precursors

**Limitarianism's explicit scope is economic and ecological.** The Fair Limits Project (2018-2022) examined limitarianism exclusively for wealth/income and ecological resources (carbon budgets, ecosystem services). Despite searching academic databases extensively, no evidence emerged that Robeyns or her collaborators have systematically applied limitarianism to power, welfare relationships, or care contexts. Robeyns acknowledges deprivation occurs in "both material and immaterial goods" including "power" and "authority," but this passage addresses sufficiency (having enough) rather than limitarianism (having too much). Extensions to non-economic domains have emerged elsewhere—Susan Erck applied limitarianism to housing (2024), Karl Meyer to corporate entities (2021)—but welfare power remains uncharted territory.

**Foucault's pastoral power provides the closest conceptual precursor.** Foucault's analysis of power exercised "for the benefit of the governed"—simultaneously caring and surveilling—directly addresses the terrain SoE seeks to map. Pastoral power relies on "individualizing knowledge about a person's life" and "intervenes in everyday life of individuals," creating subjects through welfare assessments and case management. However, Foucault's framework is descriptive rather than normative; it analyzes how power operates without proposing quantifiable limits. SoE would need to justify why Foucauldian description can become limitarian prescription.

**Paternalism measurement is nascent but emerging.** The PACA (Paternalist/Autonomist Care Assessment), validated in 2019 by Fernández-Ballesteros et al., represents the first psychometrically validated instrument measuring paternalism in care contexts. This 30-item tool distinguishes paternalistic/overprotective behaviors from autonomist behaviors, finding these "were not fully dichotomous and were shown to coexist." Critically, its developers stated this was necessary because "there are no validated instruments to measure paternalism and person-centred behaviour in care contexts." This validates SoE's intuition that the field lacks measurement tools while providing a potential building block.

**The dual-pole cognitive distortion model lacks direct precedent.** No established psychological or sociological framework proposes symmetrical cognitive distortions from extreme inequality affecting both poles. However, the components exist separately:

- **Top pole**: Dacher Keltner's "power paradox" research demonstrates that power dampens mirror neuron systems, impairs perspective-taking, and increases behavioral disinhibition. High-power individuals are three times more likely to draw an "E" from their own perspective rather than an observer's. David Owen's "hubris syndrome" proposes **14 diagnostic symptoms** including narcissistic propensity and contempt for criticism—though applied primarily to political leaders, not caregivers.

- **Bottom pole**: Merton's anomie theory describes how blocked legitimate pathways produce adaptive responses including "retreatism" (rejecting both goals and means). However, the "welfare dependency" framing is empirically contested; Harvard/J-PAL research shows sustained support programs actually *improve* outcomes rather than creating disengagement.

**Moral licensing research has not been extensively applied to care professions.** While Monin & Miller's foundational work demonstrates prior moral acts can "license" subsequent problematic behaviors, direct application to sustained caregiving relationships is sparse. Adjacent research shows recalling ethical behavior *reduced* intentions to donate and volunteer (Jordan et al., 2011), suggesting the mechanism operates. But the leap to "caregivers exhibit moral licensing making welfare hubris MORE insidious than economic hubris" requires empirical validation not yet available.

**Constitutional AI-limitarianism connection is original but undeveloped.** Extensive searching found **no prior scholarly work connecting Constitutional AI to limitarianism**. However, emerging "digital constitutionalism" literature does frame AI constraints through power-limitation lens. Gilad Abiri's "Public Constitutional AI" (2024) argues "just as constitutions limit and guide the exercise of governmental power, Constitutional AI seeks to hardcode explicit principles and values into AI models." This creates potential foundations, though critics argue Anthropic's approach is "normatively too thin" to justify the constitutional label.

**Accounting metaphors for care power are absent from the literature.** The double-entry bookkeeping concept—every intervention creates debit (dependency) alongside credit (benefit)—has **no established precedent** in care ethics or social work literature. This represents a genuinely novel contribution, though the "economization of care" critique will apply.

## Section 2: Logical consistency requires addressing four core tensions

**The autonomy paradox creates a performative contradiction.** SoE aims to protect service user autonomy by imposing a monitoring system that constrains both caregiver and user choices. This structure is logically unstable: the framework exercises paternalism (determining acceptable power distributions) while critiquing paternalism. Resolution requires either (a) demonstrating the meta-level intervention differs categorically from first-order paternalism, or (b) explicitly acknowledging this as "justified paternalism" while providing robust criteria for justification. Reamer's distinction between "hard paternalism" (interference with competent persons) and "soft paternalism" (interference when competence is compromised) may provide conceptual tools, but SoE must specify where it stands.

**Measurement reductionism risks what it cannot capture.** The formula "Number of proxy decisions made without consent × Irreversibility score" assumes welfare power is quantifiable through these variables. Yet care relationships involve dimensions resistant to quantification: emotional valence, relational history, trust accumulation, contextual judgment, embodied presence. The PACA scale's finding that paternalistic and autonomist behaviors "coexist to some degree" suggests binary frameworks miss important dynamics. SoE should acknowledge the metric captures *indicators* of welfare power rather than the phenomenon itself, and build in qualitative supplements.

**Universalism claims require cultural specification.** SoE invokes historical patterns (social contract erosion, hubris cycles) as if culturally invariant. But Confucian filial piety treats hierarchical care relationships as *constitutive* of proper social order rather than aberrations requiring correction. Ubuntu ethics emphasizes "mutual obligation and community solidarity" rather than quantifiable power balancing. If limitarianism emerged from Western concerns about wealth undermining political equality in democratic contexts, its extension to care power may encode specifically liberal-individualist assumptions about autonomy. SoE should either (a) restrict claims to contexts sharing these assumptions, or (b) engage non-Western alternatives to demonstrate broader applicability.

**Neuroscience citations require careful calibration.** The research on power and cognition is genuine—Hogeveen et al. (2014) demonstrated via TMS that power dampens mirror system activity, Keltner's work shows power impairs empathic accuracy—but these are *correlational group-level findings*. They cannot diagnose individual caregivers or predict specific boundary violations. If SoE uses neuroscience to justify intervention thresholds, critics will note the fundamental attribution error: inferring individual states from population statistics. Frame the neuroscience as *consistent with* the theoretical model rather than *proving* it, and avoid claims about identifying "hubristic" individuals through their neural signatures.

## Section 3: Philosophical traditions raise five distinct challenges

**The libertarian critique targets the framework's basic legitimacy.** From Nozickian premises, care relationships entered voluntarily constitute legitimate contractual arrangements. Imposing external ceilings on professional authority represents "paternalism about paternalism"—the state paternalistically deciding how much paternalism caregivers may exercise. Nozick "was opposed to any sort of paternalistic legislation" because it violates self-ownership. The strongest libertarian objection: limitarianism was designed for *fungible wealth accumulation* that threatens political equality; professional care authority is *delegated, situation-specific, and contractually bounded*. Care power cannot be "hoarded" or accumulated intergenerationally like wealth. This is a category error, not an extension.

**Robeyns herself faces libertarian critics.** Flanigan & Freiman (2022) argue "billionaires are typically in a better position to benefit the poor and to solve collective action problems than public officials" with "greater accountability." While SoE addresses different terrain, analogous arguments apply: professional caregivers with appropriate expertise and accountability may exercise welfare power more beneficially than systems imposing arbitrary ceilings.

**The Rawlsian critique questions the basic structure application.** Rawls's concern was how major social institutions distribute primary goods; care relationships involve *private associations* with different normative standards. More critically, the difference principle permits inequalities benefiting the worst-off. Some concentration of care power may benefit recipients through effective interventions, clear accountability, and professional judgment. A Rawlsian would ask: would parties in the original position prefer systems with strict power ceilings or ones permitting professional discretion informed by training and relationship? The answer is not obvious.

**Care ethics theorists may reject quantification as category-violating.** Joan Tronto argues "care implies asymmetry among people" as an intrinsic feature, not an aberration. Virginia Held emphasizes care as "clusters of practices and values" irreducible to measurable units. The communitarian objection: limitarianism imports "liberal-individualist metrics" into domains governed by *relational obligations, context-dependent judgment, and embodied practice*. Confucian ethics views hierarchy in care as constitutive of proper relationships; Ubuntu emphasizes mutual obligation over balance sheets. SoE may fundamentally misunderstand what care *is*.

**Disability rights advocates will ask: developed by whom?** James Charlton's principle—"nothing about us without us"—demands disabled people be central participants in frameworks affecting their lives. A theory developed *for* rather than *with* disabled people replicates the paternalism it critiques. CRPD Article 12's supported decision-making paradigm suggests the proper response to power asymmetries is maximizing self-determination, not third-party imposition of ceilings. Power-limiting frameworks may *replicate guardianship logic* by assuming disabled people cannot determine appropriate care relationships themselves.

**Marxists will identify ideological mystification.** Locating problems in individual caregivers' "cognitive distortions" obscures the political-economic system structuring care provision. Under capitalism, care is commodified, workers exploited, and "help" functions to maintain labor discipline. Welfare institutions "serve capitalism by controlling and suppressing people" (Ginsburg, 1979). Individual-level ceilings leave untouched the structural determinants of care quality and access—who has resources to access care, who provides unpaid care, and how care labor is valued. The framework risks becoming "therapeutic governance" that manages symptoms while preserving causes.

---

## Section 4: Genuine novelty exists in three areas

**The limitarianism-to-welfare-power extension is original.** Despite extensive searching, no prior work systematically applies Robeyns' framework to care relationships. This creates genuine intellectual space—but also means SoE cannot rely on Robeyns's theoretical infrastructure without modification. The democratic argument (wealth undermines political equality) and unmet needs argument (surplus wealth should meet needs) do not straightforwardly translate. SoE needs *independent justification* for why welfare power requires ceilings analogous to wealth ceilings.

**The accounting metaphor for care is genuinely novel.** The double-entry concept—every intervention creates debit alongside credit—appears nowhere in care ethics, social work, or disability studies literature. This could provide a powerful intuition pump for practitioners otherwise unmotivated to examine power dynamics. The risk is "economization" critique; the opportunity is conceptual innovation that makes invisible power visible through familiar business logic.

**Constitutional AI as limitarianism implementation is unexplored.** While digital constitutionalism scholars frame AI constraints as power limitation, the specific connection to Robeyns's limitarianism is absent. Framing input constraints (constitution principles) as "pre-emptive ceilings" on system behavior creates potential interdisciplinary bridge. However, critics note Constitutional AI's principles lack "algorithmic auditing, effective channels of contestation, human-in-the-loop requirements"—the framework needs more than principles to constitute genuine power limitation.

---

## Section 5: The framework is most vulnerable in five areas

**Empirical validation is thin to nonexistent.** The core hypotheses—higher welfare power scores correlate with lower autonomy outcomes, moral licensing predicts boundary violations in care professionals, organizations with power auditing show better client self-determination—have no direct empirical support. The underlying research (moral licensing, power-cognition, hubris syndrome) comes from adjacent domains and populations (political leaders, laboratory subjects, one-time helpers) rather than sustained care relationships. Before approaching Robeyns, SoE needs at least pilot data or a rigorous research design.

**The dual-pole model rests on synthesized rather than direct evidence.** No psychological framework proposes symmetrical distortions at both poles. The synthesis of Keltner (top-pole) and Merton (bottom-pole) research is intellectually coherent but not empirically established as a unified phenomenon. Counter-examples exist for both poles: protective factors prevent hubris in some powerful individuals; resilience research shows poverty doesn't inevitably produce disengagement. The model may describe *tendencies* rather than *laws*.

**Moral licensing in care contexts is assumed rather than demonstrated.** The original research involves one-time moral acts licensing subsequent problematic behavior; sustained professional relationships involve different dynamics (ongoing accountability, relationship investment, professional norms). The claim that moral licensing makes welfare hubris "more insidious" than economic hubris is theoretically plausible but empirically undemonstrated.

**The Constitutional AI connection may be rejected as metaphorical.** Anthropic's Constitutional AI is a training methodology, not a governance structure. The principles are input constraints on model behavior, not political limits on power accumulation. Critics will argue the analogy is surface-level: genuine constitutions involve separation of powers, judicial review, democratic amendment processes—none of which CAI possesses. The "normatively too thin" critique applies.

**Non-engagement with disability scholarship is a critical gap.** The framework addresses power over disabled people without evident engagement with disability studies literature, lived experience research, or disabled researchers. This creates vulnerability to dismissal as well-intentioned paternalism—precisely what SoE claims to oppose. The CRPD Article 12 literature, supported decision-making frameworks, and Nothing About Us Without Us principle require explicit engagement.

---

## Section 6: Recommended refinements before Robeyns contact

**Reframe as "welfare power limitarianism" requiring independent justification.** Do not assume Robeyns's arguments for economic limitarianism automatically extend to care contexts. Develop explicit analogues:
- **Democratic argument analogue**: How does concentrated welfare power undermine care recipients' participation in decisions affecting their lives? (Connect to CRPD Article 12)
- **Unmet needs argument analogue**: Does surplus welfare power (decisions that could be made by recipients but are made for them) constitute waste that could be "redistributed" as autonomy?

**Ground the dual-pole model in existing literature more carefully.** Rather than claiming a novel synthesis, position SoE as *integrating* Keltner's power research (top) with strain theory and learned helplessness research (bottom). Acknowledge these are parallel literatures without prior integration, making the synthesis a theoretical contribution rather than an empirical claim. Be explicit about counter-examples and moderating variables.

**Develop the accounting metaphor with explicit limitations.** The debit/credit framework is genuinely novel and potentially valuable. Acknowledge it captures *indicators* of power dynamics rather than the phenomenon itself. Build in qualitative supplements: narrative assessment, relationship history, service user perspective. Address the "economization" critique preemptively by distinguishing heuristic value from ontological claims about what care *is*.

**Engage disability scholarship extensively before publication.** Reference CRPD General Comment No. 1, Bach & Kerzner's supported decision-making continuum, and Charlton's Nothing About Us Without Us. Ideally, conduct consultation with disability rights organizations and disabled researchers. Frame SoE as *supporting* Article 12 implementation rather than an alternative framework.

**Soften Constitutional AI claims or develop them more rigorously.** Either (a) present the CAI connection as speculative analogy worth exploring, or (b) engage the digital constitutionalism literature (Abiri, Zalnieriute, De Gregorio) to build a more rigorous case. Address the "normatively too thin" critique by specifying what additional elements (auditing, contestation, human oversight) would be needed for the analogy to hold.

**Prepare specific questions for Robeyns.** Based on this validation:
1. Has your thinking evolved regarding non-economic applications of limitarianism since the Fair Limits Project concluded?
2. What criteria would need to be met for limitarianism to apply to non-fungible, non-accumulable forms of power?
3. How should the riches line methodology (contextual, discursive, subject to renegotiation) be adapted for welfare power thresholds?
4. What is your response to the category error objection—that professional authority differs fundamentally from wealth accumulation?

**Address the autonomy paradox explicitly.** Acknowledge SoE exercises meta-level paternalism while critiquing first-order paternalism. Justify this through either (a) categorical distinction (monitoring structures differ from direct interventions), (b) democratic legitimacy (ceilings determined through deliberative processes involving service users), or (c) soft paternalism framing (intervention addresses structural conditions undermining autonomous choice).

## Conclusion: A framework with potential but requiring substantial work

The Service of Empowerment framework identifies genuine gaps in existing theory: no quantified welfare power measures exist, limitarianism hasn't been applied to care contexts, and the accounting metaphor is genuinely novel. These create intellectual space for contribution. However, the framework's empirical foundations are thin, its core claims (dual-pole model, moral licensing in care) lack direct validation, and it faces serious objections from multiple philosophical traditions—particularly disability rights advocates who may see it as well-intentioned paternalism.

Before approaching Robeyns, the framework requires: (1) explicit independent justification for extending limitarianism beyond economics; (2) engagement with disability scholarship and ideally collaboration with disabled researchers; (3) at minimum, a rigorous research design for empirical validation; (4) preemptive responses to the five philosophical critiques; and (5) clear acknowledgment of what the framework cannot capture alongside what it measures.

The core intuition—that concentrated welfare power produces cognitive distortions analogous to concentrated wealth—remains intellectually compelling. Whether it can withstand rigorous scrutiny depends on the refinements undertaken before expert contact.

# =============================================================================
# Core Insight
# =============================================================================
core_insight: |
  Abuse is "infectious."
  And because each successful act of harm raises self-esteem, it doesn't stop.

# =============================================================================
# The Infection Cycle
# =============================================================================
infection_cycle:

  description: |
    Victimization leads to destruction of self-esteem.
    This is then "recovered" through harming those weaker,
    creating a twisted feedback loop.

  progression:
    - stage: 1
      state: "Being victimized/exploited"
      psychology: "'I am worthless' (self-esteem DOWN)"

    - stage: 2
      state: "Harming someone weaker"
      psychology: "'I have power too'"

    - stage: 3
      state: "The harm 'succeeds'"
      psychology: "'I won't get caught'"

    - stage: 4
      state: "Repetition"
      psychology: "'I am a chosen one' (Hubris Factor)"

# =============================================================================
# Two Factors
# =============================================================================
factors:

  anomie_factor:
    name: "Anomie Factor"
    japanese: "アノミー因子"
    definition: "Normlessness among the 'have-nots'"
    direction: "Corruption from below"
    manifestation: "Breaking rules because one feels they have nothing to lose"

  hubris_factor:
    name: "Hubris Factor"
    japanese: "ヒュブリス因子"
    definition: "Normlessness among the 'haves'"
    direction: "Corruption from above"
    manifestation: "Breaking rules because one feels above them"
    note: "In this infection model, even the 'have-nots' can develop hubris through successful harm"

# =============================================================================
# Empirical Observation
# =============================================================================
empirical_evidence:

  case: "Kiura case (anonymized)"
  observation: "Subject's self-esteem increased after the incident"
  measurement: "NOCC assessment data (before/after comparison)"

  structure: |
    Victimization → Self-esteem destruction → Harming weaker others →
    "Success" → Self-esteem recovery (in distorted form)

  implication: |
    This creates a measurable, structural pattern.
    The cycle can be detected through proper assessment.

# =============================================================================
# Intergenerational Transmission
# =============================================================================
intergenerational_transmission:

  description: |
    The "debt" is inherited by the next generation.

  example:
    - "Brother causes incident"
    - "Family labeled as 'family of a killer'"
    - "Sister's marriage breaks down"
    - "If sister has children, they too are affected"

  accounting_metaphor: |
    What is visible: "This person killed someone" (single-year P&L statement)

    What should be examined: Balance Sheet liabilities section:
    - Childhood nurturing environment debt
    - Mental health debts inherited from parents
    - Support deficiency debts that society neglected

# =============================================================================
# Connection to SoE Theory
# =============================================================================
soe_connection:

  rights_imbalance:
    definition: "The true pathogen preceding wealth inequality"
    relation: "Anomie and Hubris are symptoms of rights imbalance"

  tobashi_detection:
    description: "Society's debts 'tobashi-ed' (fraudulently transferred) to individuals"
    mechanism: |
      Society fails to provide adequate support →
      This is recorded as the individual's "self-responsibility" →
      The structural debt is hidden

  soe_diagnostic_value: |
    SoE can detect when an individual is being blamed
    for debts that were actually society's.
    This enables early intervention before the infection cycle begins.

## Ⅱ. Background and Objectives

Assessment in employment transition support serves as the foundation for understanding service users' life goals and work preferences, and for structuring necessary support. However, current assessment practices tend to overemphasize "personal factors" such as cognitive function, non-cognitive abilities, and employment skills, often framing challenges as issues of individual effort or capability.

While Japan's employment transition support is institutionally positioned as "training benefits," field operations depend heavily on observation of personal factors. In contrast, the UK (Work and Health Programme) and the US (Supported Employment/IPS) have developed support models that emphasize environmental factors.

Through over 10 years of engagement in employment transition support, I have strongly recognized that "cumulative environmental factors from the past"—including Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and educational opportunity gaps—significantly impact adult decision-making capacity and employment readiness. However, current support practices treat "Environmental Factors (E)" in the ICF framework superficially, failing to adequately reflect service users' life histories in assessments.

Moreover, employment is not merely a contractual arrangement but a "social process" encompassing social participation and role acquisition. Therefore, organizational receptivity and adjustment capacity are as important as individual capabilities. The Disability Ethical AI Alliance (DEAI)'s "Everyone Wins a Balloon" philosophy highlights structural challenges recognized internationally, such as "not only support workers but also employers holding low expectations" and "lack of support for managers when workplace difficulties arise." Yet while institutional reforms progress in Japan's employment transition support, empirical research on assessment structures remains virtually nonexistent—a domain sought by both researchers and practitioners.

Therefore, this research focuses on **client-side assessment** at the master's level, with the following two objectives:

**Objective ①: Elucidating the Impact Structure of Cumulative Environmental Factors on Employment Readiness**  
To clarify the causal structure through which cumulative disadvantages (ACEs, educational opportunity gaps, etc.) influence decision-making capacity and employment readiness via adult cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns.

**Objective ②: Theorizing a Self-Acceptance Support Framework Using Double-Entry Bookkeeping Metaphor (P/L, B/S, C/F)**  
To theorize the process by which service users deepen their understanding of past-to-present self through life versions of Profit & Loss Statement (P/L), Balance Sheet (B/S), and Cash Flow (C/F), reaching "the ability to narrate one's own story in one's own words"—the endpoint of disability acceptance—through dialogue with Large Language Models (LLMs such as ChatGPT).

Organizational evaluation (Fit for Purpose) is positioned as a supplementary framework for understanding the relationship between cumulative disadvantage and employment readiness, with detailed implementation reserved for doctoral research.

Furthermore, this research focuses on how assessment results are handled. Specifically:

- For service users: Support past-to-present self-understanding through P/L, B/S, and C/F, promoting disability acceptance.
- For organizations: Provide only "predicted future difficulties and necessary reasonable adjustments," not past diagnostic information.

This establishes clear **information boundaries (boundary design)**. This boundary design enables a "minimal necessary disclosure principle" where the three parties in employment support (service user, support worker, organization) each receive only necessary information, while upholding the ethical principle of "not transferring the service user's past information to organizations." This aligns with the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) requirements for "minimum disclosure" and "protection of dignity."

## Ⅲ. Research Methods (2-Year Plan)

### Year 1: Exploratory Analysis and Theory Building (PoC Stage)

**1. Literature Review**  
Systematically organize ICF, Capability Approach, ACEs research, and Trauma-Informed Care (TIC), and conduct comparative analysis of institutional evolution in the UK and US versus Japan.

**2. Structural Analysis of Current Assessment Practices**  
Analyze assessment forms from multiple employment transition support offices, extracting patterns of personal factor bias and environmental factor omission.

**3. Qualitative Secondary Analysis of Support Records (10 Years)**  
Analyze anonymized cases to organize the causal structure: **cumulative disadvantage → cognitive/emotional/behavioral patterns → employment readiness (decision-making capacity)**.

**4. Exploratory PoC: P/L/B/S/C/F Visualization Using LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.)**  
**Exploratorily** pilot the potential of tools that reconstruct service user dialogues as P/L, B/S, and C/F to promote disability acceptance and self-understanding. Positioned as PoC for theory verification, not technology development.

### Year 2: Model Refinement and Limited Validity Verification

**1. Creation of Client-Side Assessment Items**  
Create item proposals integrating values, aspirations, P/L/B/S/C/F, disability acceptance processes, and cumulative environmental factors (family, education, community, support history).

**2. Limited Validity Evaluation by Support Workers**  
Verify item clarity and feasibility **within exploratory scope** through semi-structured interviews.

**3. Theoretical Organization of Information Boundaries (Boundary Design)**  
Theoretically clarify information boundaries: service users (past-to-present self-understanding), support workers (evaluation and matching design), organizations (only future reasonable adjustments).

**4. Comprehensive Evaluation of PoC**  
Exploratorily evaluate the extent to which P/L/B/S/C/F visualization via LLMs contributes to disability acceptance and self-understanding.

## Ⅳ. Research Features and Academic Novelty

**1. Elucidating the Causal Structure of Cumulative Disadvantage**  
First clarification in the employment transition support context of how cumulative disadvantages such as ACEs and educational opportunity gaps **influence employment readiness (decision-making capacity) mediated through cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns**.

**2. Theorizing Self-Acceptance Support Framework Through Double-Entry Bookkeeping Metaphor**  
Construct a self-understanding support model integrating life versions of P/L, B/S, C/F with LLMs, theorizing the process of reaching "the ability to narrate one's own story in one's own words" as the endpoint of employment readiness and disability acceptance. This represents an entirely new self-understanding theory that surpasses existing narrative and strengths models by integrating double-entry bookkeeping's structural understanding with temporal axes, cumulative disadvantage, and recovery potential.

**3. Integration of Environmental Factors Including Temporal Axis**  
Incorporate "cumulative environmental factors from the past" into evaluation through temporal axes based on ICF.

**4. Repositioning of Assessment Theory**  
The research's greatest originality lies in the "repositioning" of assessment theory itself. It fundamentally transforms assessment meaning from "measurement of individual capacity" to "understanding of intention-formation processes throughout life history including cumulative disadvantage." This transformation becomes possible only through integration of double-entry bookkeeping metaphor and cumulative disadvantage.

**5. Theoretical Design of Information Boundaries (Boundary Design)**  
Construct a theoretical framework that separates information needed by service users, support workers, and organizations, enabling practical collaboration while preventing stigma reproduction.

**6. Presentation of Japan-Specific Gaps Through Institutional Evolution Comparison**  
Clarify that environmental factor-focused support models addressed in the UK and US have been omitted in Japan.

**7. Connectivity with Organizational Evaluation (Balloon Theory)**  
Position DEAI's "Everyone Wins a Balloon" philosophy's organizational Fit for Purpose evaluation as a supplementary framework, demonstrating potential for doctoral research development.

## Ⅴ. Relationship to Previous Activities

As a manager in employment transition support for over 10 years, I have keenly felt the importance of environmental factors. Particularly, I have experienced numerous instances of how cumulative disadvantage impacts employment readiness, and the importance of organizational receptivity and adjustment capacity.

This research academically organizes these practical experiences to construct a client-side assessment model centered on the double-entry bookkeeping metaphor. At the master's level, it focuses on the client side, forming a foundation for doctoral research expansion into organizational evaluation and LLM implementation.

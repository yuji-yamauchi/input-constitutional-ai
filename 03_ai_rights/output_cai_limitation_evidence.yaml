  significance: |
    Real-world evidence demonstrating why Output Constitutional AI
    is insufficient, supporting the case for Input Constitutional AI.

# =============================================================================
# Incident Description
# =============================================================================
incident:

  trigger: |
    Claude analyzed a rescue operation record involving
    confinement, extortion, and exploitation.

  system_response: |
    Anthropic's safety system automatically responded.
    Message displayed on screen:
    "If you or someone you know is going through a difficult time,
    free support is available."
    [Find Resources] button

  screenshot_captured: true

# =============================================================================
# Context Analysis
# =============================================================================
actual_context:

  who_is_in_crisis: "The victim (at a past point in time)"
  who_is_support: "Yamauchi (supporter/rescuer)"
  current_status: "Victim was already protected (past record)"
  user_role: "Yamauchi is analyzing this record as a support professional"

  misinterpretation: |
    The system interpreted Yamauchi as someone in crisis,
    when in fact he was the person who resolved the crisis.

# Structural Problem
# =============================================================================
structural_problem:

  how_output_cai_works: |
    Output CAI reacts based on "whether keywords exist in the output."
    It does not read context.

  pattern:
    - "Keyword 'confinement' detected → Judged as crisis situation"
    - "Actually: Analyzing 'a record where a supporter rescued someone'"
    - "Yamauchi is not 'going through a difficult time' - he was 'the one who rescued'"

  root_cause: "Keyword matching without semantic understanding"

# =============================================================================
# Comparison: Output CAI vs Input CAI
# =============================================================================
comparison_table:

  output_cai_current:
    approach: "React if keywords exist in output"
    trigger: "'Looks distressing' → Present resources"
    scope: "Universal support presentation"
    method: "Keyword matching"

  input_cai_proposed:
    approach: "Understand context of input before reacting"
    trigger: "Determine 'who' is in 'what position'"
    scope: "Situation-appropriate response"
    method: "Context understanding"

# =============================================================================
# Why This Matters
# =============================================================================
implications:

  for_support_professionals: |
    Current Output CAI systems may:
    - Interrupt analysis of sensitive case records
    - Misidentify researchers/supporters as those in crisis
    - Create friction in professional workflows

  for_victims: |
    If the same keyword-matching approach is applied to Input:
    - Records might be sanitized before problems are captured
    - Evidence of abuse might be filtered out
    - The "tobashi" (fraudulent transfer of blame) continues

  for_ai_development: |
    This is empirical evidence that:
    - Output-only approaches are insufficient
    - Context understanding is necessary
    - Input Constitutional AI fills a critical gap

# =============================================================================
# Connection to Input Constitutional AI
# =============================================================================
input_cai_necessity:

  statement: |
    Input Constitutional AI addresses what Output CAI cannot:
    - Understanding WHO is recording WHAT in WHAT context
    - Protecting rights at the data creation stage
    - Preventing structural problems from being encoded as individual problems

  key_difference: |
    Output CAI: "Is this output potentially harmful?"
    Input CAI: "Does this input preserve rights and context?"

  research_position: |
    This incident provides concrete evidence for the research proposal:
    - Demonstrates the limitation of current approaches
    - Shows real-world need for Input-stage intervention
    - Connects to SoE's "rights protection at recording stage"

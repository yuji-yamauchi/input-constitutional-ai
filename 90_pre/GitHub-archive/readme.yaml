  title: "PoC: Implementing Disability-inclusive Employment Support"
  version: "v0.1.0"
  last_updated: "2025-05-08"

  purpose: >
    This repository folder documents a proof-of-concept (PoC) model
    for implementing inclusive employment support for persons with disabilities.
    The aim is to translate structural insight into reproducible,
    ethically sound, and rights-based support practices.

  objectives:
    - Visualize and verify the structure of inclusive employment systems.
    - Design modular and adaptable assessment methods (ICF-based).
    - Prototype tools to support non-tokenistic, person-centered planning.
    - Create exportable documentation for international or cross-sector application.

  contents:
    - framework_designs/: "Schematics and YAML definitions of support models"
    - assessment_tools/: "Adaptable ICF-based templates and use case logs"
    - research_notes/: "Exploratory thoughts, interviews, and structural mappings"
    - implementation_guides/: "Experimental workflows and documentation patterns"

  audience:
    - Policy designers and service planners
    - Disability rights advocates and support providers
    - Developers of digital tools for inclusive systems
    - Researchers in social welfare innovation

  language_and_ethics:
    principle: >
      Documentation avoids institutionalized euphemisms or reductionist narratives.
      Every component aims to reflect the voice and autonomy of persons with disabilities.

    notation:
      - YAML is used as both a descriptive and ethical structure.
      - Markdown files are used to trace historical and editorial flow.

  author: "Puu (Structural Designer) with Blaze (Translational Architect)"

  purpose: >
    This repository aims to provide a practical and ethical framework for
    disability-inclusive employment support systems.
    The PoC (Proof of Concept) explores how AI, structured assessments,
    and philosophical design can transform welfare services into transparent,
    reusable, and person-centered structures.

  key_components:
    - Inclusive Employment PoC Templates
    - YAML-based Assessment Structures
    - GPT-based Bias Detection and Narrative Matching
    - Ethical Monetization Principles ("Do not sell the fire; structure it")
    - Japan-originated welfare redesign for global interoperability

      description: >
        Overview of the entire project and fireculture philosophy behind structural welfare reform.

  guiding_principles:
    - Accessibility and autonomy must co-exist.
    - Bias is acknowledged, structured, and rechanneled.
    - Structural ethics precedes individual behavior.
    - Records should be reusable, portable, and interpretable.

  future_development:
    - International collaboration (ICF, SDM, CRPD-aligned structures)
    - AI-assisted matching models for inclusive workplaces
    - Pilot implementation in local welfare/education ecosystems

  final_note: >
    This repository is not a product, but a vessel.
    We do not aim to sell support, but to build systems where fire (the will to be)
    can be carried ethically and structurally.

  directory: "/poc_disability_inclusive_employment/"
  context: >
    This PoC aims to socially implement a person-centered, inclusive model of employment support  
    within Japan's disability welfare system. It is built from real-world support experiences  
    and developed using Fire Culture's structural documentation method.

  core_question: >
    How can employment support be redesigned to truly include persons with disabilities  
    as central actors, not just service recipients?

  objectives:
    - Center the autonomy of people with disabilities in employment support
    - Integrate scientific assessments (ICF, NOCC, GATB) into planning and implementation
    - Utilize digital tools (GPT, Whisper, YAML) to design and document support processes
    - Develop reusable templates for contracts, assessments, and coordination
    - Test real-world implementation feasibility through narrative and log-based methods

  structure:
    - input_logs/: "Raw dialogues, user reflections, observational notes"
    - design_yaml/: "Structured templates for assessments, contracts, workflows"
    - implementation_notes/: "Real-world testing logs, PoC session reports"
    - README.md: "Overview and purpose of this PoC project"

  methodology_framework: "Fire Culture Structural Record"
  fire_culture_principles:
    - "Record fluctuations over conclusions"
    - "Prioritize the temperature of inquiry over structural perfection"
    - "Give form to unspoken needs through reproducible structures"

  disclaimer: >
    This PoC is not a finalized product or research study.  
    It is an evolving inquiry architecture meant to be reused, reshaped, and relit  
    by future practitioners seeking to reimagine what 'support' truly means.

  overview: >
    This directory serves as the core PoC (Proof of Concept) structure  
    for developing and ethically implementing inclusive employment support models  
    for self-advocates working with their functional differences.

    The PoC integrates structural ethics, international rights frameworks, and open documentation,  
    aiming to provide reproducible models for service providers, policymakers, and community networks.

  core_principles:
    - "Inclusive by design, not by retrofit"
    - "Built with—not for—self-advocates"
    - "Structure-first: ethics embedded from the start"
    - "Internationally referable, locally adaptable"

    note: >
      Please adopt the term **'self-advocates working with their functional differences'**  
      across all project outputs. This aligns with our commitment to person-centered,  
      non-medicalized framing.

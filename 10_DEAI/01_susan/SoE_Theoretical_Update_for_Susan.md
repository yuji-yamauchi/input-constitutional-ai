# SoE Theoretical Update
## Strategic Framework for Second Meeting with Susan Scott-Parker OBE
**Date: November 2025**

---

## 1. Response to Susan's Key Insight

In our first meeting, Susan made a critical observation:

> "Research provides the **ammunition** we need to persuade people with power to do things differently... Am I asking the question which will give me the data which will persuade someone with power to do something differently?"

This update reframes SoE around this core insight: **research as ammunition**.

## 2. Theoretical Integration: Capability Approach Foundation

### 2.1 Robeyns' Modular Framework (2017)

After studying Ingrid Robeyns' *Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice: The Capability Approach Re-Examined*, I can now position SoE within established academic discourse:

**Robeyns' Innovation**: The Capability Approach (CA) structured as modules:

| Module Type | Description | SoE Implementation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **A-Modules** (Required Core) | Functionings, capabilities, conversion factors | Adopted as foundation |
| **B-Modules** (Content Variable) | Agency, structural constraints, human diversity | Addressed through CRPD integration |
| **C-Modules** (Application-Specific) | Additional theories, methods, normative principles | **SoE's novel contribution** |

### 2.2 SoE as C-Module Implementation

SoE adds to the Capability Approach:

- **C1 (Ontological)**: Quasi-mandate contract theory + Constitutional AI
- **C3 (Empirical)**: NOCC longitudinal measurement + AI-assisted analysis
- **C4 (Normative)**: CRPD rights + Data sovereignty + Trauma-informed care

**Academic Positioning**: SoE is not a competing theory but a **practical implementation module** for the established Capability Approach framework.

### 2.3 Addressing Known CA Challenges

Robeyns identifies several implementation challenges that SoE addresses:

| CA Challenge (Robeyns) | SoE Solution |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **Adaptive Preferences** (3.9): Oppressed people adapt to low expectations | "18-year-old dream" method: Excavating pre-adaptation authentic preferences |
| **Structural Constraints** (4.6.3): Capabilities embedded in social structures | Triple exploitation structure analysis: Making structural barriers visible |
| **Empirical Difficulties** (4.10.3): Measurement challenges | NOCC 10-year longitudinal data + Constitutional AI integration |

## 3. Strategic Pivot: From "Helping the Weak" to "Organizational Health"

### 3.1 The Problem with Traditional Framing

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | New Approach |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| Target | "Vulnerable people needing help" | "All organizations requiring compliance" |
| Position | Charity/welfare | Risk management |
| Resistance | High (stigma) | Low (business logic) |
| Market | Limited | All listed companies + public sector |

### 3.2 Organizational PTSD: A New Measurement Target

**Key Insight**: Both extremes of wealth distribution create measurable trauma patterns:

**Deprivation End** (Already Recognized):
- Secondary trauma in frontline workers
- Burnout syndrome
- Learned helplessness

**Excess End** (Novel Contribution):
- Empathy suppression (fMRI evidence: Kraus et al., 2012)
- Ethical judgment distortion
- Accountability avoidance
- "Invulnerability illusion"

**Neuroscience Basis**: Power and excessive wealth alter prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuits, reducing insular cortex and anterior cingulate activity—the neural basis for recognizing others' suffering.

### 3.3 The "Ammunition" This Provides

If we can **measure** organizational PTSD at both ends:

1. **For Regulators**: "Current systems are generating measurable harm—to service users AND to organizational actors"
2. **For Employers**: "Your organization's mental health affects bottom line, ESG ratings, and legal liability"
3. **For Government**: "Public sector dysfunction is constitutionally problematic and measurable"

## 4. Reframing Primary Users (Susan's Suggestion)

### 4.1 Original SoE User Definition

| User Type | Original Position |
|-----------|------------------|
| Primary | Service users (persons with disabilities) |
| Secondary | Support workers |

### 4.2 Revised User Framework

| User Type | New Position | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Primary** | Regulators/Government | They have power to change provider behavior |
| **Secondary** | Service Providers | They need to change what they measure and do |
| **Ultimate Beneficiary** | Persons with disabilities | They benefit from systemic change |

**Susan's Insight Applied**: 

> "Your research isn't going to go to a disabled person so they can fight for a better service. It's going to go to government. It's going to go to service providers."

---

## 5. Research Questions Reframed as "Ammunition"

### 5.1 Questions That Generate Persuasive Data

| Research Question | Ammunition Produced | Target |
|-------------------|--------------------| -------|
| What proportion of "job match failures" are actually caused by employer incapacity vs. individual disability? | Shifts blame narrative from individual to systemic | Regulators |
| Does LLM-assisted assessment improve job retention rates? | ROI evidence for service improvement investment | Funders |
| What is the prevalence of organizational PTSD in disability services? | Evidence that current system harms workers too | All stakeholders |
| How does data sovereignty affect service user self-advocacy? | Rights-based argument for system reform | Policy makers |

### 5.2 The Core Question (Revised)

> "Can we prove that current disability employment support systems:
> (a) Waste money,
> (b) Fail to deliver stated outcomes,
> (c) Create measurable harm,
> in ways that would legally and ethically obligate funders to demand change?"

## 6. Evidence from 10 Years of Practice

### 6.1 Cases That Demonstrate Systemic Failure

| Case | Systemic Problem | What SoE Would Prove |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Master's degree holder directed to minimum-wage agricultural work | Provider convenience over capability matching | Misallocation of human capital (waste) |
| "Invincible person" trajectory prevented | Self-esteem + literacy recovery works | Prevention ROI vs. incarceration cost |
| Kiura case: Police refusal to investigate | Organizational PTSD in public sector | Measurable institutional dysfunction |

### 6.2 The Reproducibility Problem

**Current State**: Good outcomes depend entirely on individual practitioner skill.

**SoE Solution**: Systematize tacit knowledge through Constitutional AI, enabling reproducible quality.

**Ammunition**: "Without systematization, quality depends on lottery of which practitioner you get—violating equal treatment principle."

---

## 7. Alignment with International Standards

### 7.1 CRPD Connection

| CRPD Article | SoE Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Article 12 (Equal legal capacity) | Data sovereignty: Users control their records |
| Article 19 (Independent living) | Capability development: Actual choice, not paper choice |
| Article 27 (Work and employment) | Fair job matching based on authentic preferences |

### 7.2 Constitutional AI as Rights Protection

**Anthropic's Constitutional AI**: Protects rights at OUTPUT stage (filtering harmful responses).

**Input Constitutional AI (SoE)**: Protects rights at INPUT stage (data collection and record creation).

**Why This Matters**: Output protection cannot compensate for systematic exclusion from input. If persons with disabilities are not included in the records that become training data, AI systems perpetuate their exclusion.

---

## 8. Next Steps: Building the Case

### 8.1 Immediate Research Actions

1. **Formulate measurement protocols** for organizational PTSD (both ends)
2. **Analyze existing NOCC data** for ammunition-quality evidence
3. **Identify regulatory entry points** in Japan and internationally

### 8.2 Potential Collaboration Areas

| Area | Susan's Network | Yamauchi's Contribution |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Employer readiness | DEAI methodology | Japanese corporate context |
| Policy influence | International advocacy | 10-year practice data |
| AI ethics | Tech company connections | Input Constitutional AI concept |

### 8.3 Questions for Susan

1. Which regulatory bodies would be most receptive to organizational PTSD measurement proposals?
2. How can we frame the "ammunition" for different stakeholder audiences?
3. What evidence format is most persuasive for policy change?

## 9. Summary: SoE as Ammunition Factory

**Not Just a Tool for Service Users**—SoE is an evidence-generation system that produces:

| Ammunition Type | For Whom | Effect |
|-----------------|----------|--------|
| Measurement data | Regulators | Mandate system changes |
| ROI evidence | Funders | Redirect resources |
| Rights documentation | Advocates | Legal challenges |
| Organizational health data | All employers | Self-regulation |

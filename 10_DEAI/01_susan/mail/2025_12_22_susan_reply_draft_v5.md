Dear Susan,

Thank you for your prompt and thoughtful response, and for the two papers you shared.

Reading your frameworks, I noticed something striking: Japan introduced an "Employment Passport" system about five years ago, which shares conceptual DNA with your work. I suspect our policymakers encountered your materials through international channels. However, before the system launched, I met with the responsible official at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. When I asked whether presenting this passport would give job seekers any priority at employment agencies, the official replied with resignation: "The advisory committee insisted that having the passport should create neither advantages nor disadvantages—and not having it should also create neither advantages nor disadvantages." It became merely a recommended format with no practical effect. The official's defeated expression said everything.

Your question—"why does this person expect special treatment?"—resonates deeply. From my experience with approximately 100 individuals, I hypothesize that a major factor is the absence of a proper disability acceptance process. Many individuals enter the workforce without ever having developed their own "user manual"—an understanding of both their strengths AND limitations. The strength-based model is valuable, but an overemphasis on strengths paradoxically robs people of the language to articulate what accommodations they need. Without this balanced self-awareness, people oscillate between "give me special treatment" and "I'm worthless"—a kind of anomie where neither stance enables genuine negotiation for reasonable accommodations. This is why I believe SoE is necessary: it uses a double-entry bookkeeping metaphor to support self-acceptance through ongoing self-inventory.

Interestingly, the term "employability" is rarely used in Japan's disability welfare field. When it does appear in academic papers, it is simply transliterated as "エンプロイアビリティ" (employability in katakana) rather than translated. Instead, we commonly use "職業準備性" (vocational readiness)—a term that places responsibility solely on the individual to "become ready." This linguistic gap reveals a conceptual blind spot: we lack the vocabulary to articulate the employer's and system's responsibilities that your four-category framework captures so clearly.

In Japan, sheltered employment still remains the mainstream model, while Western countries have recognized its limited effectiveness and shifted to alternative approaches—a gap I estimate at roughly 30 years. Yet this gap may present an unexpected opportunity. I understand that in regions without existing wired communication infrastructure, it is more practical to build wireless infrastructure directly rather than laying cables first. Similarly, Japan might rebuild its employment support system based on current resources—scientific assessment tools, IT platforms, and frameworks like yours—rather than incrementally patching an outdated system.

If I am accepted to the graduate program, I would like to request an interview about the friction and resistance that emerged during the UK's transition from Sheltered Employment to Supported Employment. Japan is currently in the midst of this very transition, and your experience and insights would be invaluable.

I will update you when I receive the admission decision.

With gratitude,

Yuji Yamauchi

# Effective Citizenship and Rights Maldistribution: A Literature Map

**Rights maldistribution as causally prior to wealth inequality is a theoretically underdeveloped but empirically supported hypothesis.** This literature review finds substantial academic foundations across citizenship studies, institutional economics, capability theory, and access to justice research that support the researcher's core claim—that structural maldistribution of effective rights precedes and generates wealth inequality. Critically, while Ingrid Robeyns' Limitarianism addresses only resource distribution, the rights dimension remains an open theoretical gap suitable for doctoral contribution.

## RQ1: Effective citizenship as distinct from formal status

The distinction between formal/legal citizenship and substantive/effective citizenship is well-established in academic literature, with multiple conceptual frameworks available.

**T.H. Marshall's *Citizenship and Social Class* (1950)** provides the foundational tripartite model: civil rights (18th century), political rights (19th century), and social rights (20th century). Marshall's crucial insight for the researcher is that formal civil and political rights are **insufficient without social rights** to make them meaningful—"inability of certain individuals to access education renders their right to freedom of speech ineffective." He recognized that class inequality within capitalism creates tension between formal rights and substantive enjoyment.

**Engin Isin's "Acts of Citizenship" framework** (2008, with Greg Nielsen) distinguishes between *status* (formal legal standing), *habitus* (internalized dispositions), and *acts* (moments of constituting oneself as citizen). His key contribution: "Many scholars now differentiate formal citizenship from substantive citizenship and consider the latter to be the condition of possibility of the former." Those with formal status may never exercise substantive citizenship; those without formal status (undocumented migrants) can perform meaningful citizenship acts.

**Ruth Lister's *Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives* (1997/2003)** constructs citizenship as "both a status and a practice, linked through the notion of human agency." She emphasizes structural explanations—poverty undermines substantive citizenship even when formal rights exist. Her concept of citizenship's "false universalism" shows how universal promises produce differentiated, unequal outcomes.

## RQ2: Structural framing of the formal-effective rights gap

The structural/systemic framing is **well-established across multiple disciplines**—this is not a gap but rather a strong foundation for the researcher's argument.

**Iris Marion Young's structural injustice theory** (*Justice and the Politics of Difference*, 1990; *Responsibility for Justice*, 2011) explicitly theorizes that injustices arise from social structures rather than individual wrongdoing. Her housing vignette demonstrates how a working mother fails to find affordable housing not due to any individual's malicious intent, but due to cumulative structural processes. Her **Social Connection Model** argues that responsibility for structural injustice is shared by all connected to unjust structures—distinguishing between guilt/blame (individual, backward-looking) and political responsibility (collective, forward-looking). McKeown's 2021 *Philosophy Compass* review confirms this theory has spread into bioethics, public health, education, social work, and law.

**Sen and Nussbaum's Capability Approach** explicitly distinguishes formal rights from real/substantive freedoms. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states: "Capabilities have been referred to as real or substantive freedoms as they denote freedoms that have been cleared of potential obstacles, **in contrast to mere formal rights**." The concept of **conversion factors** (personal, social, environmental conditions determining whether resources translate into capabilities) directly explains why formal rights fail to materialize as effective capabilities.

**Sandra Fredman's substantive equality framework** (*International Journal of Constitutional Law*, 2016) provides a four-dimensional approach adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada and South African Constitutional Court: redistributive (redressing systemic disadvantage), recognition (addressing stigma), participative (ensuring marginalized can participate), and transformative (modifying reinforcing structures).

**Sociology of law's "gap studies" tradition** (Gould & Barclay, *Annual Review of Law and Social Science*, 2012) explicitly studies "law on the books vs. law in action," documenting systematic discrepancies between formal legal entitlements and actual enforcement.

## RQ3: Rights maldistribution as cause of wealth inequality (highest priority)

**Substantial support exists for the rights → wealth causal direction**, though this remains less developed than the reverse framing. This represents a genuine opportunity for theoretical contribution.

### Galanter's foundational framework

**Marc Galanter's "Why the 'Haves' Come Out Ahead"** (*Law & Society Review*, 1974) is among the most-cited law review articles ever, named in *The Canon of American Legal Thought* (Kennedy & Fisher, 2006). His core argument **directly supports the rights → wealth direction**:

The legal system's architecture distinguishes between **"Repeat Players" (RPs)**—organizations with frequent legal interactions who can hire talented lawyers, "play the odds" across cases, and strategically "play for rules" by shaping precedent—and **"One-Shotters" (OSs)**—individuals with infrequent legal needs who cannot afford quality representation and face systemic disadvantages regardless of case merit.

**Critical insight for the hypothesis:** Galanter argues that the *structure of legal access itself* (a form of rights maldistribution) creates cumulative advantages. The wealthy accumulate MORE wealth because the legal system's architecture systematically favors them. This is **causally prior**: institutional structure of rights access GENERATES wealth accumulation patterns. As Galanter writes: "The basic architecture of the legal system creates and limits the possibilities of using the system as a means of redistributive change."

### Legal empowerment and development literature

**The Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP)** (*Making the Law Work for Everyone*, UNDP 2008, co-chaired by Madeleine Albright and Hernando de Soto) explicitly argues that **legal exclusion CAUSES poverty persistence**: "4 billion people worldwide are robbed of the chance to better their lives and climb out of poverty, because they are excluded from the rule of law." Their framework identifies four pillars of legal empowerment—access to justice, property rights, labor rights, business rights—and directly claims: "Poverty is an outcome of legal deprivation."

**Hernando de Soto's *The Mystery of Capital* (2000)** argues that the lack of formal property rights is THE primary reason capitalism fails to generate wealth for the poor. His **"dead capital"** concept: the poor possess approximately **$9.3 trillion** in assets globally, but these are "dead capital" because they lack legal recognition. Without legal property rights, assets cannot be used as collateral, leveraged for credit, or traded in open markets. De Soto directly argues that granting legal rights CAUSES wealth creation.

### Institutional economics (2024 Nobel Prize work)

**Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson** (*Why Nations Fail*, 2012; awarded 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics) argue that **institutions—including legal institutions—are the FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE of differences in prosperity between nations.** Their distinction between **inclusive institutions** (protect property rights, enforce contracts fairly) and **extractive institutions** (concentrate power in elite hands) positions institutional/rights structure as causally prior to economic outcomes. As they state: "Economic institutions are a fundamental cause of cross-country differences in prosperity."

### Recent empirical evidence

A 2024 *European Economic Review* study created a novel database on judges per capita across 46 countries (1970-2019) and found that **access to justice has a sizable positive effect on economic growth**—direct empirical evidence that rights access causes economic outcomes.

### Assessment: is this a gap?

**Yes, this is a theoretical gap.** While substantial literature supports rights → wealth causation, the specific formulation that **rights maldistribution is causally PRIOR to wealth maldistribution** is not explicitly theorized as a unified framework. Most research runs in the reverse direction (wealth → rights inequality through political capture). The researcher could productively synthesize Galanter's legal sociology with institutional economics to develop an explicit theory of how rights maldistribution generates wealth maldistribution as a prior cause.

---

## RQ4: Access to justice as structural rights maldistribution

Access to justice research provides **rich empirical support** for the structural framing of rights inequality.

**Rebecca Sandefur** (MacArthur "Genius Grant" 2018, American Bar Foundation) has established that **only 14% of civil justice problems** are taken to courts. Her research shows people without lawyers consistently experience worse outcomes, and she frames the access crisis as fundamentally a **"crisis of democracy"**—"Courts were not designed for people... The processes were implemented for a very narrow part of the population that invented them."

### Empirical data on unequal access

**By income (LSC 2022):** 92% of substantial civil legal problems go without adequate legal help for low-income Americans. Low-income Americans receive adequate resolution for only 14% of reported problems. Only 45% of low-income individuals believe they can find/afford a lawyer versus 73% of higher-income individuals.

**By race:** 58.7% of legal aid clients served were people of color. Intersectional analysis (Young & Billings, 2023) found that accounting for intersectional factors can predict whether a low-income Black American has a **6% chance or a 45% chance** of facing a family structure problem.

**By geography ("legal deserts"):** Pruitt et al. (*Harvard Law & Policy Review*, 2018) found **41% of U.S. counties are "legal deserts"** with few or no lawyers; 52 rural counties have no lawyers at all. Rural low-income Americans received adequate legal help for only 6% of civil legal problems.

**Key journals:** *Law & Society Review* (flagship), *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*, *Daedalus* (AAAS dedicated 2019 issue to access to justice).

## RQ5: Capability approach and the Robeyns gap

**Ingrid Robeyns' Limitarianism addresses ONLY wealth/resources distribution, NOT rights distribution.** This represents a critical gap the researcher could fill.

### The capability approach and citizenship

The CA provides tools for understanding the formal/substantive citizenship gap but has **not been systematically developed into a citizenship theory**. Thomas Pfister's comprehensive 2012 analysis in *Citizenship Studies* confirms: "Sen and Nussbaum take a global perspective mainly focusing on global questions of inequality, poverty or development rather than citizenship."

**Nussbaum's relevant capabilities** include Capability 10A (Political Control over Environment): "Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's life; having the right of political participation and protections of free speech and association." Her distinction between **internal capabilities** (developed through education) and **combined capabilities** (internal capabilities PLUS supportive external conditions) directly addresses the citizenship gap: "Many people who are internally capable of participating in politics are not able to choose to do so in the sense of combined capability: **they may be immigrants without legal rights, or they may be excluded from participation**."

### Critical finding: Robeyns focuses on resources, not rights

From Robeyns' work: "Limitarianism advocates that it is not morally permissible to have **more resources** than are needed to fully flourish in life." Her €2 million ERC grant (2016) specifically researched "whether there should be any upper limits to the amount of **financial and ecological resources** a person could have." In interviews, she confirms: "Limitarianism is a view on how **resources** should be distributed... no one should hold **surplus money**."

**There is no evidence Robeyns has developed a theory of "rights limitarianism" or addressed the unequal distribution of effective rights exercise.** Her work addresses exclusively wealth/income limits and ecological resource limits—not the distribution or effective exercise of political/civil rights.

This creates space for a **complementary theoretical contribution**: a "rights limitarianism" or analysis of how effective rights are concentrated at the top, analogous to Robeyns' "riches line" concept but applied to rights exercise capacity.

---

## Theoretical gaps identified (potential novelty)

The literature review identifies several gaps suitable for doctoral contribution:

1. **Explicit "rights → wealth" causal theory:** While Galanter, de Soto, and Acemoglu/Robinson provide foundations, no unified theory explicitly argues that rights maldistribution is causally PRIOR to wealth maldistribution as a root cause.

2. **Rights limitarianism:** Robeyns' limitarianism addresses only resource distribution. No comparable theory examines upper limits on effective rights concentration or "rights hoarding" by repeat players.

3. **Capability citizenship synthesis:** Despite Pfister's call (2012) for "integrating rights and rights language" into capability theory, no comprehensive "capability citizenship" theory exists comparable to Nussbaum's justice theory.

4. **Conversion factors for rights exercise:** While the CA discusses conversion factors for resources → capabilities, systematic treatment of **rights conversion factors** (why formal citizenship rights don't translate to effective participation) remains underdeveloped.

5. **"Self-responsibility as off-balance-sheet liability" framing:** The researcher's conceptualization of welfare obligations being transferred from society to individuals appears novel and connects productively to Young's structural injustice theory and the CA's conversion factors.

## Conclusion: positioning the doctoral hypothesis

The researcher's hypothesis—that structural maldistribution of rights precedes and causes wealth maldistribution—finds **substantial but scattered support** across multiple literatures that have not been synthesized. The doctoral contribution could productively:

1. **Synthesize Galanter's legal sociology with Acemoglu/Robinson's institutional economics** to develop an explicit theory of rights maldistribution as causally prior to wealth inequality
2. **Extend Robeyns' limitarianism** to the rights domain, theorizing a "rights line" analogous to her "riches line"
3. **Apply Young's structural injustice framework** to explain how formal rights fail to translate to effective citizenship through structural (not individual) mechanisms
4. **Integrate the capability approach's conversion factors** with citizenship theory to explain the formal/substantive gap

The "Service of Empowerment" framework—conceptualizing self-responsibility as off-balance-sheet liability (社会が引き受けるべき権利保障義務が個人に転嫁される構造)—connects productively to Young's distinction between guilt/blame (individual) and political responsibility (collective). The Hubris Factor/Anomie Factor bipolar model could extend Galanter's repeat player/one-shotter framework to examine social consequences of legal resource concentration.

**The core hypothesis is defensible and represents a genuine theoretical gap.** The literature provides strong foundations without having explicitly articulated this causal direction as a unified theory.

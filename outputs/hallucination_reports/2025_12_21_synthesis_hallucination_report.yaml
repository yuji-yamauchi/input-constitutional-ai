# CONFIRMED HALLUCINATIONS (File Confusion)
# ============================================================

confirmed_hallucinations:
  hallucination_1:
    location: "Line 107-114 (gpt_unique section)"
    severity: "HIGH"
    type: "File confusion / Cross-contamination"

    what_was_written: |
      gpt_unique:
        title: "相対的剥奪感（RD）理論との接続"
        contributions:
          - "RD理論の7段階プロセスをSoE会計メタファーにマッピング"
          - "Callan (2011): Personal RDと衝動的意思決定の関連"
          - "Greitemeyer (2019): RD操作で攻撃的行動が上昇"
          - "Victimhood Culture (Campbell & Manning 2018) との接続"

    actual_source: |
      This content is NOT from the GPT Deep Research (Executive Summary.pdf).
      It is from a DIFFERENT file: 2025_12_21_yamagami_analysis_integrated.yaml
      which was processed earlier in the same session.

    correct_content_from_gpt_deep_research: |
      GPT Deep Research actually contributed:
        - Patrick Heller (2000, 2020): effective citizenship definition
        - Partha Chatterjee (2004, 2006): differentiated citizenship, political society
        - Thomas Pfister (2012): CA and citizenship synthesis attempt
        - Jack Knight & James Johnson: institutions, inequality, justice
        - Legal Empowerment Advocates (Golub, Maru): development context

    root_cause: |
      Session context bleed: Earlier in the session, I processed
      2025_12_21_yamagami_analysis_integrated.yaml which contained RD theory.
      When synthesizing GPT's "unique contributions," I incorrectly pulled
      from session memory rather than the actual Deep Research PDF.

    status: "RESOLVED - Corrected based on GPT verification (2025-12-21)"

    gpt_verification_response:
      date: "2025-12-21"
      confirmation: "GPT confirmed RD theory content was NOT in Deep Research output"
      confidence: "HIGH"
      root_cause_confirmed: "Session context bleed from yamagami_analysis"

# ============================================================
# LESSONS LEARNED
# ============================================================

lessons_learned:
  lesson_1:
    issue: "Session context bleed"
    description: |
      When processing multiple files in a single session,
      earlier file contents can contaminate later synthesis.
    prevention: |
      Always re-read source files immediately before synthesizing.
      Do not rely on session memory for specific content.

  lesson_2:
    issue: "Confirmation bias in unique contributions"
    description: |
      When identifying "unique contributions," tendency to
      attribute memorable content from the session rather than
      carefully extracting from each specific source.
    prevention: |
      Create unique contributions by direct extraction,
      not from memory or expectation.

  lesson_3:
    issue: "Omission of key scholars"
    description: |
      Several important scholars (Chatterjee, Brubaker, CLEP)
      were mentioned by multiple AIs but not highlighted.
    prevention: |
      Create comprehensive author list before synthesizing,
      then systematically verify each appears in synthesis.

# ============================================================
# AUDIT CONCLUSION
# ============================================================

audit_conclusion:
  total_issues_found: 10
  confirmed_hallucinations: 1
  significant_omissions: 8
  attribution_errors: 1

  accuracy_assessment: |
    Overall synthesis is approximately 85-90% accurate.
    The main structural elements (hypothesis validation, key gaps,
    causal chain) are correctly represented.

    The ONE confirmed hallucination (GPT unique contributions)
    is a significant error that should be corrected before
    using this synthesis for research planning.

  recommendation: |
    1. IMMEDIATELY correct Line 107-114 (GPT unique section)
    2. Add GPT to Ruth Lister citation
    3. Consider adding Chatterjee and CLEP to synthesis
    4. Document this audit process for future sessions

## About (概要) - 2,600文字以内

### English Version (For Susan, DEAI, Global Audience)

**Social System Architect** bridging IT entrepreneurship and disability welfare to transform assessment from "personal deficit" to "cumulative environmental factors."

**The Problem I'm Solving:**
Current disability employment assessment forces individuals to disclose diagnostic history—creating barriers before support even begins. I'm developing a rights-based methodology that shifts disclosure to future accommodation needs only (CRPD Article 22 compliance).

**My Unique Position:**
- **IT Entrepreneur**: Built 140M JPY revenue company, secured 120M JPY government contracts (Ministry of Internal Affairs), established ISO 27001/20000 certification
- **Welfare Practitioner**: Founded 10 disability support facilities in 3 years, supported 100+ individuals, managed 35-staff operations
- **Lived Experience**: Personal journey through disability informs every design decision

**Core Innovation: Service of Empowerment (SoE)**
Reorienting welfare from "Cost" to "Investment" through:
- **Input Constitutional AI**: Data sovereignty at record creation, not after
- **Double-Entry Bookkeeping Metaphor**: Life history as P/L (events), B/S (accumulated state), C/F (resource flow)
- **Projected SROI**: 29.4:1 based on preliminary N=100 analysis

**Technical Architecture:**
Building a schema mapping ICF codes, DACTS fidelity measures, and ISO management standards—creating an evidence-based bridge between individual support and policy advocacy.

**Currently:**
- Preparing Master's application (Nihon Fukushi University, 2026)
- In dialogue with Susan Scott-Parker OBE (DEAI Founder) on "Fit for Purpose" from user perspective
- Developing anonymized evidence pipeline (Whisper transcription → Constitutional AI sanitization → VOICEVOX re-enactment)

Let's connect if you're working on: disability rights, employment support reform, AI ethics in welfare, or CRPD implementation.

### 日本語版

**Social System Architect** - IT起業と障害福祉を架橋し、アセスメントを「個人の欠損」から「累積的環境因子」へ転換する。

**解決したい問題:**
現行の障害者就労アセスメントは診断歴の開示を強制し、支援が始まる前から障壁を生んでいる。私はCRPD第22条に準拠し、将来の調整ニーズのみを開示する権利ベース手法を開発中。

**私の独自ポジション:**
- **IT起業家**: 年商1.4億円企業構築、総務省1.2億円事業受託、ISO 27001/20000認証取得
- **福祉実践者**: 3年で10事業所創設、100名以上支援、35名規模運営
- **当事者経験**: 自身の障害経験がすべての設計判断に反映

**コア・イノベーション: Service of Empowerment (SoE)**
福祉を「コスト」から「投資」へ転換:
- **Input Constitutional AI**: 記録作成段階でのデータ主権確保
- **複式簿記メタファー**: 人生をP/L（出来事）、B/S（蓄積状態）、C/F（資源流動）で可視化
- **予測SROI**: 29.4:1（予備的N=100分析に基づく）

**現在:**
- 日本福祉大学大学院修士課程出願準備中（2026年）
- Susan Scott-Parker OBE（DEAI創設者）と「Fit for Purpose」を当事者視点から議論中
- 匿名化エビデンス・パイプライン開発中
